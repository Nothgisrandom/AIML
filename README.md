In this activity, I explored the differences in bar coupons acceptance rates versus drivers atttibutes.
Key findings are:
1.	 Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over 25 are 70% likely to accept the coupon.
2.	 Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers who were not kids, and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry had a higher acceptance rate (71%) than other drivers (30%)
3.	 Other Driver groups have less than 50% probability of accepting the bar coupons.
