In this activity, I explored the differences in bar coupon acceptance rates versus drivers' demographics and other variables.
Key findings are:
1.	 Drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over 25 are 70% likely to accept the coupon.
2.	 Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers who were not kids and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry had a higher acceptance rate (~70%) versus other drivers (~30%)
3.	 Other Driver groups are less than 50% likely to accept the bar coupons.
